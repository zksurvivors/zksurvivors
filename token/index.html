<p><a href="#"><b>Zksurvivors ( ZKS ) Tokenomics :</b></a></p>

<p>The collective ideation that the term tokenomics encompasses includes a wide range of concepts that define the science and behavior of blockchain economies.
In basic terms, tokenomics are the financial foundation of blockchains.
Much the same way a building with a poor foundation is doomed to fail,
a blockchain without a well-researched, extensively planned, and painstakingly implemented token economy eventually crumbles.</p>

<p>Zksurvivors ( ZKS ) tokenomics are based on sound financial concepts informed by extensive blockchain research.
Designed for scale, the Zksurvivors ( ZKS ) tokenomic structure is designed to support the financial needs of web3 now and into the future.</p>

<p><a href="#"><b>The Zksurvivors ( ZKS ) economy :</b></a></p>

<p>Users submit transactions to the ZkBazaar platform to create, mutate, and transfer digital assets or interact with more sophisticated applications enabled by smart contracts, interoperability, and composability.</p>

<p><a href="#"><b>Core components :</b></a></p>

<p>The Zksurvivors ( ZKS ) economy is composed of five core components:</p>

<p><a href="#"><b>ZKS :</b></a> The ZKS token is the zkBazaar platform native asset.</p>

<p>Gas fees : Gas fees are charged on all network operations and used to reward participants of the proof-of-stake mechanism and prevent spam and denial-of-service attacks.</p>

<p>Storage fund : The ZKS storage fund is used to shift stake rewards across time and compensate future validators for storage costs of previously stored on-chain data.</p>

<p>Proof-of-stake: The delegated proof-of-stake mechanism is used to select, incentivize, and reward honest behavior by ZKS Validators and the ZKS owners that stake with them.</p>

<p>Voting: On-chain voting is used for governance and protocol upgrades.
